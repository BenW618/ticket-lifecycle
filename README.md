First, I went to the website localhost/osTicket/. From there, I created 3 tickets. The first one I created was by Karen and it was a “Business Critical Outrage” ticket. The second one was created by Ken and it was a “Personal Computer Issue” ticket. The last one was created by Karen again and it was a “General Inquiry” ticket. After creating these three tickets, I closed the website and went back to the original osTicket website. Once I was there, I logged into the website using Jane’s login info.You may watch the Youtube video linked above to watch me create the tickets.

The next thing I did was adjust the settings of the tickets. For each ticket, I adjusted the priority level, the SLA Plan, and who it was assigned to. The one ticket that was “business impacting”, I assigned a Department for them. You may watch the Youtube video linked above to watch me adjust them.

After adjusting the settings of the tickets, I proceeded to resolve the tickets. You may watch the Youtube video linked above to watch me solve them.
